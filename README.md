## 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📝 Overview  
This project uses R to analyze telecom customer data and predict churn behavior. Multiple classification models were tested to identify the most accurate method for supporting customer retention strategies.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques  
- **R**, tidyverse, e1071, rpart, randomForest, gbm  
- **EDA**, Feature Binning, Classification Models, AUC/ROC Evaluation

## 📈 Key Results  
- Evaluated 6 models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, Decision Tree, Boosting  
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression with **AUC = 0.8465** and **Accuracy = 80.28%**  
- Outperformed all other models, including LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree  
- Delivered 3 actionable business recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention
